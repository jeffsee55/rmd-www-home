# Building apps

Apps on GitHub allow you to automate and improve your workflow. You can build apps to improve your workflow. You can also share or sell apps in GitHub Marketplace. To learn how to list an app on GitHub Marketplace, see "Getting started with GitHub Marketplace."

GitHub Apps are the officially recommended way to integrate with GitHub because they offer much more granular permissions to access data, but GitHub supports both OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps. For information on choosing a type of app, see "About apps" and "Differences between apps."

If you are using your app with GitHub Actions, GitHub imposes restrictions on how apps can edit Actions workflow files to help keep your repository secure. To learn more, see "Managing workflows."

For a walkthrough of the process of building a GitHub App, see "Building Your First GitHub App."
